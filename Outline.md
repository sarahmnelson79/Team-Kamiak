# Pitch template:

## Focus

Build an interactive-searchable website for Palouse anthropological collections from the Museum of Anthropology at Washington State University and Anthropology collections at University of Idaho

## Digital scholarship addresses specific needs, challenges, issues or problems.

### What set of challenges does your project meet? 

The collections are not fully-searchable other than searching in Windows or doing invdividual queries.

### What question is your project trying to answer? 

How to gain information about Palouse anthropological collections or specific artifact types in the WSU or U of I collections?

### What issue does your project engage with? 

Researcher's ability to find information about their topic or research area.

## Proposed Solution or Template

There is no one way to address a set of questions, but there is your way! How will you go about solving the problem or engaging with the question?

  a) building a new tool: We will be building a new website (and re-using other templates) to be able to search the collections.

  b) producing a new set of workflows: The website will also require creating a new workflow in processing .csv files or .txt files to use in the website.

  c) linking together content in new ways: This will also require linking the website to the collections databases.

## Environmental scan

Chances are other people have had similar challenges or are tackling similar or related problems or issues. An environmental scan is a detailed look at (should engage with at least 3):

### Work-to-date that deals with your topic (i.e.â€”has a similar focus, set of inquiries or shares similar content)

A variety of museums, academic instituions, arts institutions, Digital Humanities & Sciences, libraries, etc. are using CollectiveAccess to manage their collections online. 

Several other websites and software do similar things for managing collections and presenting them to researchers (see notes.txt).

### Tools that engage with your problem/solution

We have looked at several tools including [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) and [Mukurtu](http://mukurtu.org/). We have chosen to use Mukurtu, as some artifacts may be sensitive for indigenous communities; therefore, we want to be able to control access to those artifacts.


## Project Description

This is your elevator speech, or your brief abstract that you will use to hook people in whether they be funders, stakeholders or potential collaborators.



## Sustainability

All digital scholarship must engage with the question of sustainability.

### Who or what institution will host your project? Is there a cost?

The Center for Digital Scholarship and Curation at Washington State University will host this project. There are no current costs to hosting.

### What tools or infrastructure is needed to maintain your project?

For some custom portions of the Mukurtu implementation, it would be required to update code and maintain those functions over time.

### What people and communities are need to engage and maintain the project?

This project will engage with a wide array of people and communities, including, but not limited to: indigenous communities around and on the Palouse, anthropologists/archaeologists from private companies, universities, or other research insitutions, the public, particularly on the Palouse, and elementary, middle school and high school students.

### What might be the needs in five years for people to continue to use, engage with or build on your project?

Being able to incorporate 3D scans and images to interact with, also being able to provide more metadata and a variety of information from different voices, incorporating new technologies and digital displays for the collection. Ongoing maintenence and updates of the Mukurtu site.

### Is the initial scope realistic?

Yes, the initial scope is to upload the information into the Mukurtu platform. It is likely that students would be needed to be able to upload and contribute the information. It would be important to talk to potential users to find out what types of information are the most helpful and would be most useful for research.

### Is the data in a transferable, re-usable format?

Most of the metadata are in .csv files or would at least have to be converted from the museums database, which uses paradox.
