# Pitch template:

## Focus

Build an interactive-searchable website for Palouse anthropological collections from the Museum of Anthropology at Washington State University and Anthropology collections at University of Idaho

## Digital scholarship addresses specific needs, challenges, issues or problems.

### What set of challenges does your project meet? 

The collections are not fully-searchable other than searching in Windows or doing invdividual queries.

### What question is your project trying to answer? 

How to gain information about Palouse anthropological collections or specific artifact types in the WSU or U of I collections?

### What issue does your project engage with? 

Researcher's ability to find information about their topic or research area.

## Proposed Solution or Template

There is no one way to address a set of questions, but there is your way! How will you go about solving the problem or engaging with the question?

  a) building a new tool: We will be building a new website (and re-using other templates) to be able to search the collections.

  b) producing a new set of workflows: The website will also require creating a new workflow in processing .csv files or .txt files to use in the website.

  c) linking together content in new ways: This will also require linking the website to the collections databases.

## Environmental scan

Chances are other people have had similar challenges or are tackling similar or related problems or issues. An environmental scan is a detailed look at (should engage with at least 3):

### Work-to-date that deals with your topic (i.e.â€”has a similar focus, set of inquiries or shares similar content)



### Tools that engage with your problem/solution



### Similar projects




## Project Description

This is your elevator speech, or your brief abstract that you will use to hook people in whether they be funders, stakeholders or potential collaborators.



## Sustainability

All digital scholarship must engage with the question of sustainability.

### Who or what institution will host your project? Is there a cost?


### What tools or infrastructure is needed to maintain your project?


### What people and communities are need to engage and maintain the project?


### What might be the needs in five years for people to continue to use, engage with or build on your project?


### Is the initial scope realistic?


### Is the data in a transferable, re-usable format?
